# About The Project
This project was created with assistance while I was watching a lesson from Teacher Lira on the Hashtag Programação YouTube channel.

I don’t think there is any merit of my own in this; I personally didn’t create anything here, just copied.

I believe that the learning process is like the description by Kirby Ferguson in his video called "Everything is a Remix," where he explains that to create anything new, the journey involves copying, combining, and transforming.

Based on this, I'm taking my first step.
